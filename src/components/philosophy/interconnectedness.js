                <p>One of the difficulties in philosophy is the apparent lack of any foundation for knowledge.  If we ask about Ethics, what is good and bad, we will end up asking about people and their minds: consciousness.  We will end up asking about the nature of the world: ontology.  We will end up asking how we know about those things, and with what certainty: epistemology.  Each of those questions will similarly lead back around to the others when one examines them in enough detail.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Critical Rationalism offers a way to at least ignore this problem, and purportedly eliminate it as an actual problem, by simply acknowledging that there are no foundations for knowledge, and that at any time we are not attempting to build a consistent and complete worldview, but rather just to solve a given problem.</p>
