                <p>We often refer to "things" that are not physical objects, like "the number 2", or to apparent physical objects that have fuzzy definitions or boundaries, like "the planet Earth", or to structural concepts, like "the game of chess".  This can lead to questions about what exactly these "things" are, ontologically.  The number 2 does not appear to be an object in physical space, but we can refer to <i>instances</i> of its instantiation in different circumstances.  Considering the Earth as a single object raises questions with no clear answer, like when a rocket ship launched from the surface stops being "part of" the Earth".</p>
                <br />
                <p>One of the traditional problems in this area is that something like "the Earth" appears to be not an abstract object, but a concrete one, and so too with other apparent physical objects referred to by different descriptions.  One's bed or chair is not abstract, but concrete.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I resolve this question by claiming that abstractions are all the possible entities referred to within a given information-processing framework, and that most of the apparent problems created by the question of the status of physical objects is actually an artifact of our way of talking and thinking.
                In the sense of Taoism, the only physical object is The World.  While the world admits of variation and difference, the specific categorizations and separations that we see in the world refer not to it, but to us, and to our way of perceiving it, on the basis of the structure of the process that underlies our thinking.
                When we refer to "the chair" or to "the Earth", there is a physical world that forms the basis for the correspondence between our ideas and itself, but the chairness and Earthness are properties of our minds and their organization.
